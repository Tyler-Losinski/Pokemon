These minisprites are free to use, they were collected by the smogon forum memebers over here:

Credit and a link back is appreciated for large scale projects.
Because of the nature of 3DS capture cards there are small colour variances. This is unavoidable to date, but these icons are the highest quality ones out there.

If you are a sprite fan also consider looking at the Smogon XY Sprite Project:
